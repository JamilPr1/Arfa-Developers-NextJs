# AI Chat Setup Guide (Free / No API)

## What’s implemented now

This website now uses a **free/no-API** approach:

- A floating **“Chat with AI”** button opens **ChatGPT** in a new tab.

## Important limitation

There is **no legitimate way** to embed “free ChatGPT” and have it reply inside your website **without an API key** (OpenAI or another provider) or without running your own AI model on a server.

## Optional upgrade (recommended)

If you want a true on-site chatbot that answers visitors directly (real-time AI in your UI), I can add:

- an on-page chat widget UI
- a secure `/api/chat` route
- OpenAI API integration using your subscription/API key (server-side)

## Testing

1. Visit your website
2. Click **Chat with AI** button (bottom-right)
3. It should open ChatGPT in a new tab
